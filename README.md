# Keylogger
//This Keylogger captures and saves every keystroke into a text file named keylog.txt in the working directory.
Code is written in Python. and you need to run the Python file manually into the system.
To stop it you need to either need to go to system cli and stop the program by Ctrl+C or you can do it from the task manager itself. ( By searching and stopping the program.)

Another EXE version of the Keylogger is there if any Windows computer Doesn't have Python installed in it.

there is an autorun.inf file. If you want to put all of them into a flash =drive the autorun file executes it automatically. although the modern computer doesn't have an autorun feature anymore for security reasons but user can run the file as soon as the drive is put into the system with a pop-up that says run the file.
