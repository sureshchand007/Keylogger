# Keylogger
//This Keylogger captures and saves every keystroke into a text file named keylog.txt in the working directory.
Code is written in Python. and you need to run the Python file manually into the system.
To stop it you need to either need to go to system cli and stop the program by Ctrl+C or you can do it from the task manager itself. ( By searching and stopping the program.)
